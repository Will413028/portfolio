### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by searching the entire project for `FIXME:` to make quick customizations. Here are some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/BaseTemplate.tsx`: default theme
- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

You have full access to the source code for further customization. The provided code is just an example to help you start your project. The sky's the limit 🚀.

### Deploy to production

You can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ pnpm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. To test the generated build, run:

```shell
$ pnpm run start
```

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your preferred browser to see the result.

### Useful commands

### Code Quality and Validation

The project includes several commands to ensure code quality and consistency. You can run:

- `pnpm run lint` to check for linting errors
- `pnpm run lint:fix` to automatically fix fixable issues from the linter
- `pnpm run check:types` to verify type safety across the entire project
- `pnpm run check:deps` help identify unused dependencies and files
- `pnpm run check:i18n` ensures all translations are complete and properly formatted

#### Bundle Analyzer

Next.js Boilerplate includes a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.
