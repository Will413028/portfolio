Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
pnpm install
```

For your information, all dependencies are updated every month.

Then, you can run the project locally in development mode with live reload by executing:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

> [!CAUTION]
> The authentication system requires environment variables to be set up. Please refer to the [Set up authentication](#set-up-authentication) section.

Need advanced features? Multi-tenancy & Teams, Roles & Permissions, Shadcn UI, End-to-End Typesafety with oRPC, Stripe Payment, Light / Dark mode. Try [Next.js Boilerplate Pro](https://nextjs-boilerplate.com/pro-saas-starter-kit).

### Set up authentication

To get started, you will need to create a Clerk account at [Clerk.com](https://clerk.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=nextjs-boilerplate) and create a new application in the Clerk Dashboard. Once you have done that, copy the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` values and add them to the `.env.local` file (not tracked by Git):

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_pub_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

Now you have a fully functional authentication system with Next.js, including features such as sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password, reset password, update profile, update password, update email, delete account, and more.

### Translation (i18n) setup

For translation, the project uses `next-intl` combined with [Crowdin](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js). As a developer, you only need to take care of the English (or another default language) version. Translations for other languages are automatically generated and handled by Crowdin. You can use Crowdin to collaborate with your translation team or translate the messages yourself with the help of machine translation.

To set up translation (i18n), create an account at [Crowdin.com](https://l.crowdin.com/next-js) and create a new project. In the newly created project, you will be able to find the project ID. You will also need to create a new Personal Access Token by going to Account Settings > API. Then, in your GitHub Actions, you need to define the following environment variables: `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`.

After defining the environment variables in your GitHub Actions, your localization files will be synchronized with Crowdin every time you push a new commit to the `main` branch.

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by searching the entire project for `FIXME:` to make quick customizations. Here are some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/BaseTemplate.tsx`: default theme
- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

You have full access to the source code for further customization. The provided code is just an example to help you start your project. The sky's the limit 🚀.

### Commit Message Format

The project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, meaning all commit messages must be formatted accordingly. To help you write commit messages, the project provides an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is the ability to automatically generate GitHub releases. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### CodeRabbit AI Code Reviews

The project uses [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai?utm_source=next_js_starter&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=next_js_starter_oss_2025), an AI-powered code reviewer. CodeRabbit monitors your repository and automatically provides intelligent code reviews on all new pull requests using its powerful AI engine.

Setting up CodeRabbit is simple, visit [coderabbit.ai](https://www.coderabbit.ai?utm_source=next_js_starter&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=next_js_starter_oss_2025), sign in with your GitHub account, and add your repository from the dashboard. That's it!

### Testing

All unit tests are located alongside the source code in the same directory, making them easier to find. The unit test files follow this format: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`. The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with the following command:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

### Integration & E2E Testing

The project uses Playwright for integration and end-to-end (E2E) testing. Integration test files use the `*.spec.ts` extension, while E2E test files use the `*.e2e.ts` extension. You can run the tests with the following commands:

```shell
pnpx playwright install # Only for the first time in a new environment
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### Storybook

Storybook is configured for UI component development and testing. The project uses Storybook with Next.js and Vite integration, including accessibility testing and documentation features.

Stories are located alongside your components in the `src` directory and follow the pattern `*.stories.ts` or `*.stories.tsx`.

You can run Storybook in development mode with:

```shell
pnpm run storybook
```

This will start Storybook on http://localhost:6006 where you can view and interact with your UI components in isolation.

To run Storybook tests in headless mode, you can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm run storybook:test
```

### Local Production Build

Generate an optimized production build locally:

```shell
pnpm run build-local
```

This only creates the build, it doesn't start the server. To run the build locally, use `pnpm run start`.

### Deploy to production

You can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ pnpm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. To test the generated build, run:

```shell
$ pnpm run start
```

You also need to defined the environment variables `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` using your own key.

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to see the result.

### Deploy to Sevalla

You can deploy a Next.js application on [Sevalla](https://sevalla.com). First, create an account on [Sevalla](https://sevalla.com).

After registration, click `Application > Create an App`. After connecting your GitHub account, select the repository you want to deploy. Keep the default settings for the remaining options, then click `Create`.

Go to `Environment variables > Add environment variable`, and define the environment variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` from your Clerk account. Click `Save`.

### Code coverage

Next.js Boilerplate relies on [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/codecov-free-trial/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=paid-community&utm_campaign=general-fy25q1-nextjs&utm_content=github-banner-nextjsboilerplate-logo) for code coverage reporting solution. To enable Codecov, create a Codecov account and connect it to your GitHub account. Your repositories should appear on your Codecov dashboard. Select the desired repository and copy the token. In GitHub Actions, define the `CODECOV_TOKEN` environment variable and paste the token.

Make sure to create `CODECOV_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret, do not paste it directly into your source code.

### Logging

The project uses LogTape for logging. In the development environment, logs are displayed in the console by default.

For production, the project is already integrated with [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=next-js-boilerplate) to manage and query your logs using SQL. To use Better Stack, you need to create a [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=next-js-boilerplate) account and create a new source: go to your Better Stack Logs Dashboard > Sources > Connect source. Then, you need to give a name to your source and select Node.js as the platform.

After creating the source, you will be able to view and copy your source token. In your environment variables, paste the token into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_STACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` variable. You'll also need to define the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_STACK_INGESTING_HOST` variable, which can be found in the same place as the source token.

Now, all logs will automatically be sent to and ingested by Better Stack.



### Useful commands

### Code Quality and Validation

The project includes several commands to ensure code quality and consistency. You can run:

- `pnpm run lint` to check for linting errors
- `pnpm run lint:fix` to automatically fix fixable issues from the linter
- `pnpm run check:types` to verify type safety across the entire project
- `pnpm run check:deps` help identify unused dependencies and files
- `pnpm run check:i18n` ensures all translations are complete and properly formatted

#### Bundle Analyzer

Next.js Boilerplate includes a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
pnpm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.
